# Session Notes

## Current Status
- Last Updated: January 13, 2025
- Phase: Project Initialization

## Session 1 - January 13, 2025

### What We Accomplished
- Initialized local git repository
- Created project structure with README.md and .gitignore
- Created remote repository on GitHub (https://github.com/mr2magic/book_scanner)
- Established connection between local and remote repositories
- Made initial commit and pushed to remote
- Documented communication standards (minimal output preference)

### What We Learned
**Technical Discoveries:**
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) is available and authenticated
- Repository created successfully with public visibility
- Default branch is `master` (can be renamed to `main` if preferred)

**Decisions Made:**
- Used public repository visibility (can be changed if needed)
- Included comprehensive .gitignore for Python, IDE, OS, and environment files
- Set up remote as `origin` following standard convention

**Gotchas & Pitfalls:**
- None encountered during initialization

### Code Changes
- Created `README.md` - Basic project description
- Created `.gitignore` - Standard ignores for Python, IDE, OS files, and environment variables
- Created `SESSION_NOTES.md` - This file for tracking project progress

### Next Steps
1. Define project requirements and architecture for book scanner application
2. Choose technology stack (Python, frameworks, libraries)
3. Set up development environment and dependencies
4. Create project structure and initial codebase
5. Implement core scanning functionality

**Open Questions:**
- What type of book scanning functionality is needed? (OCR, barcode scanning, image processing, etc.)
- What is the target platform? (Desktop app, web app, mobile app)
- What file formats need to be supported?
